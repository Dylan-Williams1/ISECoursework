Manual for Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Search Configuration Tuning Tool
===========================================================================

Overview:
---------
This tool is designed for automatically tuning configurations of software systems within a constrained evaluation budget. It supports two methods:

- Random Search (RS): baseline method for randomly selecting configurations.
- Genetic Algorithm (GA): intelligent search method based on evolutionary algorithms.

Prerequisites:
--------------
- Python 3.8 or later installed
- Dependencies installed from `requirements.txt`

Install dependencies:
---------------------
Run the following command from your project's root directory:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Directory structure:
--------------------
- datasets/           : Input CSV datasets for different systems.
- GA_RawRunData/      : Results produced by GA.
- RS_RawRunData/      : Results produced by Random Search.
- GAsearch_results/   : Individual GA run results.
- search_results/     : Individual RS run results.
- GA.py               : Genetic Algorithm implementation.
- RandomSearch.py     : Random Search implementation.

Usage:
------
### Run Random Search:
    python RandomSearch.py

This generates result CSV files under the folder `search_results`.

### Run Genetic Algorithm:
    python GA.py

This generates result CSV files under the folder `GAsearch_results`.

### Run Multiple Tests (for statistical analysis):

- For Genetic Algorithm multiple runs:
    python testGA.py

- For Random Search multiple runs:
    python testRS.py

Output:
-------
- Each run's best fitness scores are stored under `GA_RawRunData` and `RS_RawRunData`.
- Summary statistics (`mean`, `standard deviation`) are automatically computed.
